BOB v0.6 ECO notes  #1

R15  0.01 ohm needs the 1206 footprint for higher tolerance availability.

Add another 0603 cap in parallel with C3 2.2uF. This is to add hi-freq filtering ie. a 0.1uF cap.  I noticed it helped 
clean up the DC output.

Change C8 & C11 to 220uF for boost circuit stability.  I would also go with a 1210 footprint, there is plenty of room for it.
Reasong being availability is so much better, and so is thermal dissipation in a PWM application.   
To note, in many applictions the tantalums are verboten because of their toxicity.   Some future investigation into 
ceramic/electrolytic caps might be worthwhile. Lo- ESR etc.
Something along these lines for now:

Remove all inside pad trace bridging, and make ample external trace connection for easier hacking, also probably would even out
the surface tension solder flow dynamics.

Remove the internal polarity silksreens on JP1, JP2, JP3, JP7

Make the QFN pads a bit longer for easier hand-fix & hackability

Drill hole near charge connector is blocking the polarity marking on the top silk.
